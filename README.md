The code is fully written by AI. It's a simple loop using if statements to monitor your keyboard inputs (keys defined in the file), and 'presses' Xbox controller buttons in response. 

**Mapping:**
Changing the mapping is as simple as replacing the keyboard buttons in the code. 

**Multi-Binding**
You can also multi-bind keys (binding the same keyboard input to multi Xbox buttons or vice versa) by copying and pasting the corresponding if statements.
