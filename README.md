This project's code is fully written by AI. It's a simple loop that uses 'if statements' to monitor your keyboard inputs (keys defined in the file), and 'presses' Xbox controller buttons in response. 

**Mapping**

Changing the mapping is as simple as replacing the keyboard keys in the code. 

**Multi-Binding**

You can also multi-bind keys (binding the same keyboard input to multi Xbox buttons or vice versa) **by copying and pasting the corresponding 'if statements'.**

**Emulating Multiple Controllers**

You can emulate multiple controllers simply by copying the code to another file and changing the mapping.
